# E-Book

A reactive mini Electronic Bookstore project frontend

## Version 1

Front-end version 1 can be found [here](https://github.com/kmykoh97/e-Book)  
Please note that front-end prototype has been rewritten to version 2 in this repository to enable reactive rendering using Ajax. Complicated design philosophy in version 1 has been depreciated to make use of easier back-end design philosophy.
